This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages("stringi")
devtools::install_github("lmullen/mullenMisc")            
                 
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(mullenMisc)
```


```{r}

birthplace <- read.csv("~/Clio3/week7/nhgis0024_ds17_1870_county.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
birthplace

codebook <- parse_nhgis_codebook("~/Clio3/week7/nhgis0024_ds17_1870_county_codebook.txt")
#gives us a dataframe with code and meaning - code "ALF001" = "Alabama"
#so we know what we are doing.. look at this table to figure out the meaning
#but who has time for that - going to JOIN

codebook
```{r}
birthplace %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  gather(code, value, starts_with("ALF"))%>%
  left_join(codebook) %>%
  #filter(str_detect(meaning,"Germany")) %>%
  group_by(STATE, meaning) %>%
  summarize(total_pop = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_pop)) %>% View

  

```


```
