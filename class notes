3 constraits to write a program - 
	1. imperative programming - tell it to do something, then tell it to do the next thing
	2. object-oriented programming- program arranged around objects
	3. functional programming - creating vocabulary and putting it together grammatically
		stitch words together to make more complex meaning than with any single function.


		Goal: how do I write a function, how do i design a function so that it gives me useful inputs and useful outputs?


Basics of JavaScript

- its ok to look at examples early on - not cheating

- 

string = anything between ""

objects can have properties added to them
var a = {title: "Clio3", courseNumber: "HIST698"};

var b = [1,2,3]

b[1]
2
b[0]
1
b[2]
3
b[3]
undefined

anything can go inside array , can array of strings, can call on them to do many things

c.join
c.shift()  = pulls things out of an array
c.pop() = last thing in the element
c.push() = adds things to the beginning

can put objects in an array

functions: something that does something
brackets = body of function - anything inside is part of function

var myFunc = function(x) { return x + "hi!"}

in javascript - variable can be string, sometimes when java doesn't know what you want to do with something it will try to do it for you.

take variables and pass them into a function and function will do something with it

typeof (if want to know what something is can use call what it is)
	typeof 4
		number
	typeof "R"
		string

always use === version

&& - and
|| - or

two ways to define a function

Looping:
- for loop creates a counter, does something for as many times as you tell it
	3 parts
		- name the variable ;
		- name a conditional we'll keep doing it as long as the for statement is true;
		- i++ - take soemthing and add one


often will want to step through array, define a counter variable, run it through array then specify
