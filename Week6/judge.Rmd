These are the judge database attempts: 

The first step to cleaning up the data and trying to look at it
```{r}

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

dirtyJudge <- read.csv("historydata/jb.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dirtyJudge <- tbl_df(dirtyJudge)
#dirtyJudge


#whew, file is too big to preview. Let's filter out some data we're interested in.

managableJudge <- dirtyJudge %>%
  select(lastname = Judge.Last.Name,
         firstname = Judge.First.Name,
         middlename = Judge.Middle.Name,
         birth = Birth.year,
         death = Death.year,
         gender = Gender,
         raceth = Race.or.Ethnicity,
         court = Court.Name)
managableJudge
         
#okay, more managable, but still ugly. 

```

```{r}
# Let's look at the judges in chronological order by birth year
chronologyJudge <- managableJudge %>%
  arrange(birth)
chronologyJudge

median(chronologyJudge$birth, na.rm = TRUE)
# median year of birth for judges = 1923
# lets look at median age

ageJudge <- managableJudge %>%
  mutate(ageJudge = death - birth)

median(ageJudge$ageJudge, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(ageJudge$ageJudge, na.rm = TRUE)

# median age for the judges is 76, mean age is 75.23 (this is more like lifespan than age... )
# that was fun. I guess.

```

  
```{r}
#Let's look at how many female judges there are!
# First, we'll make sure there are no empty gender fields - organize by gender so I can look through.
genderJudge <- managableJudge %>%
  arrange(gender)
genderJudge

# great. All M or F, add a filter and see ONLY female Judges

femaleJudge <- managableJudge %>%
  filter(gender == "F")
femaleJudge

# great - but that I still have to look to see how many there are or how many male judges there are: give me a number and do the work for me!

gendersJudge <- managableJudge %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarize(amountGender = n())
gendersJudge

```


```{r}
#what can I learn about the distribution of race/ethnicity?

reJudge <- managableJudge %>%
  group_by(raceth) %>%
  summarize(distribRE = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(distribRE))
reJudge

#fascinating.
```

```{r}
#next I'd like to play with race and gender - this will require me to mutate/spread the column to set a new variable. Ran out of time.
```
