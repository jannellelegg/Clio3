```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(historydata)
library(ggplot2)

#cleaning up some of my own data on 1900 census
rawdata <- read.csv("historydata/1900Census.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
rawdata
  
censusTidy <- rawdata %>%
  tbl_df() %>%
  select(year = Census.year,
         respondants.total = Total.Population,
         respondants.deaf = number.deaf,
         - ratio.of.population) %>%
  gather(respondant, results, -year)
censusTidy
```

```{r}
# let's play with the data a bit - what if I need a specific year? or sample size?
oneYear <- censusTidy %>%
  filter (year == 1900)
oneYear

sample10000 <- censusTidy %>%
  filter (results >=10000)
sample10000
        
# if I wanted to organize them by population size
popSize <- censusTidy %>%
  arrange(results)
popSize

```

```{r}
# if I want to get the number of the total pop in a given year, minus 
# the deaf population ( the hearing population)- I can compare with rawdata 
# and use mutate to compare the columns and create a new one

censusCompare <- rawdata %>%
  select(year = Census.year,
         totalpop = Total.Population,
         deafpop = number.deaf,
         -ratio.of.population)
censusCompare

hearingPop <- censusCompare %>%
  mutate(hearingpop = totalpop - deafpop)
hearingPop
  
```

```{r}
# or I can use censusTidy and use spread() to extract the different pops
# from the respondants column and compare it using mutate

hearingPop2 <- censusTidy %>%
  spread(respondant, results) %>%
  select(year,
         totalpop = respondants.total,
         deafpop = respondants.deaf) %>%
  mutate(hearingpop2 = totalpop - deafpop)
hearingPop2

```

```{r}
# or if I want to add up the total number of deaf respondants
# though this wouldn't be any indication of population size as a number of
# respondants would be potentially be counted a few times- but let's see what
# happens anyway

addDeaf <-hearingPop2 %>%
  summarize(totaldeaf = sum(deafpop))
addDeaf

```

```{r}
# Ignore the failures below!
#Got it to work, but now ratio is in the same column as respondants and
# causing problems. Moving it around.

#censusTidy <- censusTidy %>%
 # tbl_df() %>%
  #select(Census.year,
   #      respondants.total = Total.Population,
    #     respondants.deaf = number.deaf,
     #    ratio = ratio.of.population) %>%
#  gather(respondant, results, ratio, -Census.year)
#censusTidy

#Nope, now respondants are split in columns
# I'd rather just remove the ratio column altogether
# Just removing the ratio options doesn't work

#censusTidy <- censusTidy %>%
 # tbl_df() %>%
  #select(Census.year,
   #      respondants.total = Total.Population,
    #     respondants.deaf = number.deaf,
